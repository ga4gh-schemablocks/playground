  The callset object contains information about an experiment performed on 
  material from a single biosample and provides a shared identifier for all 
  variants detected in this experiment, attributed to the referenced biosample.
type: object
properties:
  id:
    description: |
      The local-unique identifier of this callset (referenced as "callset_id").
    type: string
    examples:
      - 'GSM264198'
  biosample_id:
    description: |
      The identifier ("biosample.id") of the biosample this variant was 
      reported from. This attribute provides an alternative to an implicit 
      variant -> callset -> biosample chaining.
    type: string
    examples:
      - 'pgx-bs-987647'

    description: |
      Data use conditions applying to data from this callset, as ontology class 
      (e.g. DUO).
    examples:
      - id: 'DUO:0000004'

  geo_provenance:
    description: |
      This geo_class attribute ideally describes the geographic location of 
      where this callset was analysed.

            The cnv_maps object is a wrapper for genomic interval mapped status 
            information. In Progenetix and arrayMap, this is used to indictate 
            for fixed 1MB genome intervals - the status
            - dupmap => "DUP" or ""
            - delmap => "DEL" or ""  
            or the maximum / minimum positive / negative value encountered in 
            the segment, as far as it has been called to contain DUP or DEL.
