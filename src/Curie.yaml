  A CURIE constitutes a "Compact URI" or Abbreviated syntax for expressing 
  Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). CURIEs consist of a prefix and a private 
  ID part, separated by a colon.
  
  Some design considerations:    
  
  * Prefixes should *not* be concatenated; there should only be a single colon 
  in the CURIE.
  * While the underscore `_` character is considered a "safe" character in all 
  computing environments and is a "word character" in regular expression 
  matching, it nevertheless should be _avoided_ as part of the private portion 
  of a CURIE, since in some environments it has been used as replacement for 
  the prefix separation (in replacement for the colon character `:`).
