  Individual:
    description: |
      An individual is a single organism (here typically a human).
    status: proposed
    properties:
      id:
        description: The local-unique identifier of this individual (referenced as "individual_id").
        type: string
        example: 'AM_BS__NCBISKYCGH-1993'
      name:
        type: string
        description: |
          A short descriptive "name" for the individual, which may or may not correspond to a "real name". Unstructured text.
        example: 'Ion Tichy, space explorer'
      description:
        description: A free text description of the individual.
        type: string
        example: 'patient with lung cancer, male smoker'
      data_use_conditions:
        ref: './Ontology_term'
        description: |
          Data use conditions applying to data from this individual, as ontology object (e.g. DUO).
        example:
          id: 'DUO:0000004'
          label: 'no restriction'
      organism:
        description: |
          An NCBI taxonomy term describing the species of the individual.
          For resources where there may be more than one organism being studied it is advisable to indicate the taxonomic identifier of that organism, to it's most specific level
        ref: './Ontology_term'
        example:
          id : 'NCBITaxon:9606'
          label : 'Homo sapiens'
      sex:
        description: |
          A PATO term describing the biological sex of the individual
        ref: './Ontology_term'
        example:
          id: 'PATO:0020000'
          label : 'female genetic sex'
      geo_provenance:
        description: |
          This geo_class attribute ideally describes the geographic location of where this individual originates from.
          This value may reflect either the place of birth or residence, but frequently may correspond to the place the study was performed.
        ref: './Geo_location'
        example:
          label: 'Str Marasesti 5, 300077 Timisoara, Romania'
          city: 'Timisoara'
          country: 'Romania'
          latitude: 45.75
          longitude: 21.23
          altitude: 94
      external_references:
        description: |
          Different representations of the same record, not different records in relation with this individual
        type: array
        items:
          ref: './Reference'
        example:
          - description: 'Cellosaurus cell line identifier'

            description: |
              The query will return all individuals which have been reported in experiments in this publication.
      biocharacteristics:
        description: |
          list of Phenotype objects with properly prefixed term ids, describing features of the individual which are not specific to the reported biosample(s); typical examples here are sex, species and "systemic" phenotypes and diseases
        type: array
        items:
          ref: './Phenotype'
        example:
          - description: 'Patient with Down syndrome'
