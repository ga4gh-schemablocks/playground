      TODO OntologyClass on its own uses CURIEs without defining the prefixes. It may also not permit
      or adequately describe the use of paired terms as required by DUO:0000007.
      Should define something that specifies what the CURIE prefix means, allows for paired terms, and can restrict
      to be a subclass of DUO:0000001 (data use permission).
    examples:
      - { "id": "DUO:0000042", "label": "general research use" }
      - { "id": "DUO:0000007; MONDO:0007263", "label": "disease specific research; cardiac rhythm disease" }
