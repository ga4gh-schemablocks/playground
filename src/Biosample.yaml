  A Biosample refers to a unit of biological material from which the substrate 
  molecules (e.g. genomic DNA, RNA, proteins) for molecular analyses (e.g. 
  sequencing, array hybridisation, mass-spectrometry) are extracted.
  
  Examples would be a tissue biopsy, a single cell from a culture for single 
  cell genome sequencing or a protein fraction from a gradient centrifugation. 
  
  Several instances (e.g. technical replicates) or types of experiments (e.g. 
  genomic array as well as RNA-seq experiments) may refer to the same Biosample.
  
  FHIR mapping: [Specimen](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/specimen.html).
type: object
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    description: |
      The local-unique identifier of this biosample (referenced as 
      "biosample_id"). This is unique in the context of the local (e.g. 
      server, resource) instance.
    examples:
      - 'AM_BS__NCBISKYCGH-1993'
  project_id:
    type: string
    description: |
      The id attribute of the project that this biosample was collected in.
    examples:
      - 'ind-cnhl-1293347-004'
  individual_id:
    type: string
    description: |
      In a complete data model "individual_id" points to the "id" of the 
      individual ("donor", "subjerct"...) this _Biosample_ was derived from.
      
      In a local context this could be the _id_ attribute in a corresponding 
      "individuals" collection.
    examples:
      - 'ind-cnhl-1293347-004'
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      A short descriptive name for sample which should be sufficient to 
      distinguish it from other samples in the project or collection. 
      This is a label or symbolic identifier for the biosample.
    examples:
      - 'Sample BRCA-00429, 2nd replicate'
  description:
    type: string
    description: |
      A free text description of the biosample. This should not contain any 
      structured data.
    example: 'Burkitt lymphoma, cell line Namalwa'
  data_use_conditions:
    "$ref": https://schemablocks.org/schemas/ga4gh/DataUseConditions.json # TBD
    description: |
      Data use conditions applying to data from this biosample, as data use 
      condition object (e.g. DUO).
    examples:
      - id: 'DUO:0000004'
        label: 'no restriction'
  age_at_collection:
    "$ref": https://schemablocks.org/schemas/ga4gh/Age.json
    description: |
      The age of the individual at time of biosample collection, as Age object.
    example:
      age: 'P56Y'
      age_class:
        id: 'HP:0003621'
        label: 'Juvenile onset'
  biocharacteristics:
    description: |
      The _Biocharacteristics_ object represents a wrapper list of "Phenotype" 
      objects with properly prefixed term ids, describing features of the 
      biosample.  
      Examples would be phenotypes, disease codes or other ontology classes 
      *specific to this biosample*, i.e. not general features of the individual 
      it was derived from.  
      In a complete data model (variants->[callsets]->biosamples->individuals), 
      characteristics applying to the _individual_ (e.g. sex, most phenotypes) 
      should be annotated with the individual.

  geo_provenance:
    description: |
      This geo_class attribute ideally describes the geographic location of where the sample was extracted.
      Frequently, this value may reflect either the place of the laboratory where the analysis was performed, or correspond to the corresponding author's institution.
