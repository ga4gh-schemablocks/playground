### Attributes
  
__Type:__ string  
__Pattern:__ ^\w[^:]+:.+$  
__Description:__ A CURIE constitutes a "Compact URI" or Abbreviated syntax for expressing 
Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). CURIEs consist of a prefix and a private 
ID part, separated by a colon.

Some design considerations:    

* Prefixes should *not* be concatenated; there should only be a single colon 
in the CURIE.
* While the underscore `_` character is considered a "safe" character in all 
computing environments and is a "word character" in regular expression 
matching, it nevertheless should be _avoided_ as part of the private portion 
of a CURIE, since in some environments it has been used as replacement for 
the prefix separation (in replacement for the colon character `:`).
